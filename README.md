When "Add A Department" is selected, the user is prompted to enter the name of the department and that department is added to the database.

When "Add A Role" is selected, the user is prompted to enter the name, salary, and department for the role and that role is added to the database.

When "Add An Employee" is selected, the user is prompted to enter the employeeâ€™s first name, last name, role, and manager, and that employee is added to the database.
